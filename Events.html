	<h2>Train with a Bully!</h2>
			<p>Join us every Thursday at the center for educational seminar on basic dog training. Bring your pet or get a chance to meet one of our adoptees by training with them. If bringing your own pet, they must be leashed at all times and up to date on vaccinations. For safety purposes, any dogs with behavioral issues may not be allowed in the facility. Remember, there is no such thing as an aggrssive breed only misunderstood dogs. Must sign up at the center before attending.</p></div>
